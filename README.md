# MS2-Holiday-Destinations
This site is intended for people of all walks of life who seek a break from life's everyday's woes. A dream destination, complete with chosen perks, or not...

The site aims to provide an idea of what's in store for your desired outcome, whether it be country or activity, and what it will take to achieve it.

## UX
---
This site will focus on families of all sizes, whether they are alone or as a couple shouldn't matter. We want to help families find their desired holiday destination.

Therefore, as a person seeking a break-

Or as a person who is just browsing for ideas-

* *I want to be able to locate a desired country/city*
* *I want to discover what activities lay in store in that country. Resturants?*
* *Where would I live, for the duration of the holiday? Hotels?*
* *How much would everything, or certain things cost? Price range?*
* *How will I book a desired choice?*
