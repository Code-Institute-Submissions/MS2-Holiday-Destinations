This site is intended for people of all walks of life who seek a break from life's everyday's woes. A dream destination, complete with chosen perks, or not...

The site aims to provide an idea of what's in store for your desired outcome, whether it be country or activity, and what it will take to achieve it.

## UX

This site will focus on families of all sizes, whether they are alone or as a couple shouldn't matter. We want to help families find their desired holiday destination.

Therefore, as a person seeking a break-

Or as a person who is just browsing for ideas-

* *I want to be able to locate a desired country/city*
* *I want to discover what activities lay in store in that country. Resturants?*
* *Where would I live, for the duration of the holiday? Hotels?*
* *How much would everything, or certain things cost? Price range?*
* *How will I book a desired choice?*

## Deployment
---
* **Gitpod** - Previewing the site in gitpod is done through the command "python3 -m http.server" (without quotes). Once the command is used, 
a popup with port 8000 will ask you to either "Make Public" or "Open Browser". You can click on "Make Public" first and if another popup arrives you 
click on "Open Browser" in order to see the site. Alternatively, you can ctrl-click on the port 8000 link that will be shown in the terminal. There is no autosave 
so saving after each change is optimal, as well as commiting to github. The template used here was the full template issued by Code Insitutite.

* **Github** - Deployment was done through github pages. The documentation of which can be found here: https://pages.github.com/ 
Through the settings of the repository, in the options menu, scrolling down to GitHub pages and saving and publishing through there. 
It took some time to deploy, but eventually after some minutes the site was up.

The deployed site is functional and succesfull. The link is here; https://windmost8.github.io/MS2-Holiday-Destinations/index.html
